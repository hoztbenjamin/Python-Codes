# The ANL305 assignemnt is the group report done for ANL305 Association and Clustering. IBM SPSS Modeller was used for both Apriori Association rule mining and K-means clustering

# The association analysis model was used to identify the association rules between variables such as parents' education level, marital status, etc to the respective students' math scores. Using the Apriori Algorithm, two rules were identified which have a higher tendency to fail their math test, which can be used to alleviate the issue of failure. The difference between association and causation was also discussed. 

# For the clustering portion of the project, the k-means model was used to determine the groupings of different pulsars based on their respective moving features. Using k = 2, the k-means model produced 4 different clusters which differentiates pulsars into class 1 and class 0. The average silhouette measure when k = 2 is 0.7, with an optimal mislabelling rate of 22.27% as compared to 24.59% for k = 3 and 38.5% for k = 4.
